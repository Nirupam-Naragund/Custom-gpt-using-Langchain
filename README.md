# Custom-gpt-using-langchain


This project demonstrates a Streamlit web application that integrates with Langchain, allowing users to interact with a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. The application supports uploading PDF documents, processing text from the documents, and engaging in conversational interactions.

## Features

- **Ask Questions**: Users can input questions to interact with the GPT model.
- **Upload Documents**: PDF documents can be uploaded for text processing.
- **Conversational History**: The application keeps track of the conversation history.
- **Save Conversation**: Users can save the conversation for future reference.
